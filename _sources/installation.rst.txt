Installation
============

Unfortunately, you cannot just :code:`pip install SimpleTensor`.

However, you can go to the GitHub repository and download / clone
the repo. If the file is downloaded as a zip, you must unzip it.

Then, you can :code:`cd` to the directory and run
:code:`pip install .`. This will run because there will be a
pyproject.toml file in the repository, so pip will recognize
it and install it automatically. After the installation, you can
delete this repository folder (I think).
